This is the code repository of Cemu, a Wii U emulator that is able to run most Wii U games and homebrew in a playable state.
It's written in C/C++ and is being actively developed with new features and fixes to increase compatibility, convenience and usability.

Cemu is currently only available for 64-bit Windows and Linux devices.

## Download

You can download the latest Cemu releases from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases/) or from [Cemu's website](https://cemu.info).

Cemu is currently only available in a portable format so no installation is required besides extracting it in a safe place.

See [Current State Of Linux builds](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/issues/1) for information on using Cemu natively on Linux.

Pre-2.0 releases can be found on Cemu's [changelog page](https://cemu.info/changelog.html).

## Build Instructions

To compile Cemu yourself on Windows or Linux, view the [BUILD.md file](/BUILD.md).

## Issues

Issues with the emulator should be filed using [Github Issues](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/issues).  
The old bug tracker can be found at [bugs.cemu.info](https://bugs.cemu.info) and still contains relevant issues and feature suggestions.

## Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome. For easier coordination you can visit the developer discussion channel on Discord: [https://discord.gg/5psYsup](https://discord.gg/5psYsup).

If coding isn't your thing, testing games and making detailed bug reports or updating the (usually outdated) compatibility wiki is also appreciated!

Questions about Cemu's software architecture can also be answered on Discord. Alternative communication channels (like IRC) are being considered.
